Combine meeting with Cris - 12/18/17
- https://github.com/DAZSLE/ZPrimePlusJet/blob/zqqjet2016/fitting/ZqqJet/buildRhalphabet.py

- pt v rho -> mtw v mt
- polynomial orders (3,4) -> (2,2)
- Keep lines 483-495 for now (in MakeWorkspace function)
- QCDeff needs to change
- buildPolynomialArray needs to be hacked to grab parameters from my own files
- get rid of signal chopping (on low and high ends)

- input histograms should already have per event and flat weights
- base.root and ralphabase.root are outputs

- need hist_...test.root from cris to do tests
- getting script to output the 2D plots (has res mass and jet mass already - just need to change cuts)

To grab specific github repo subdirectory
svn checkout https://github.com/DAZSLE/ZPrimePlusJet/branches/zqqjet2016/fitting

Steps to run ralphabet
python buildRhalphabet.py -b
python makeCards.py
- run whatever the last line of output from makeCards.py is
mv ralphabase.root_34_pt ralphabase_34_pt.root
