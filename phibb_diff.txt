1. Not standalone. Need to initialize instance of class and call run()
2. Derives QCD efficiency on each run
3. Define background and signal names in __init__
4. Uses dictionaries in LoopOverPtBins
5. workspaceInputs -> GetWorkspaceInputs
6. LoadHistograms is totally different
* More inputs
* Dictionaries 
7. Removed scaleHists (which I wanted to do)
8. buildPolynomialArray changed
* no longer reads in 'guesses' from previous run
* pVal -> start (but not used?)
9. buildRooPolyArray does Pt/mass instead of Pt/rho (buildRooPolyRhoArray does Pt/rho)
10. lPass -> roopolyarray
11. rooTheHistFunc -> GetRooHistFitObjects
12. No signal interpolation in MakeWorkspace
